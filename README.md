For the first question, I created a class employee and defined a static method average slary to calculate the average salary of the employee. For the full time employee I created a class called fullTime employee and inherited the employee class and created an instance of both employee and fulltime employee, to print the result of number of employee and average salary of each employees I called the average salary method .
And for the 2nd question where we dealt with numpy I imported the numpy library. To generate the random vector with values between 1 and 20 I used np.random.uniform function. To reshape the generated vector I have used reshape method from numpy. with arguments. (4,5). To return the max element along axis 1 I used the np.argmax function, to replace it with 0 by traversing the matrix i used the np.arange method, and printed it.
